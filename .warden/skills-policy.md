# Skills policy — nightgate-demo

Written by `warden init`. The Nightgate skill pack reads this file, and each
section below is required
(https://github.com/NightWatchEng/nightgate/blob/main/docs/wiki/Skills-Policy.md).
Replace the defaults as the project's practice settles.

## Verify

- Any code change: `warden verify --scope node`
- Repair budget: `repo.yaml`'s `repair.budget` key; this line only points at it.

## Autonomy scope

No project-specific exclusions beyond the platform baseline.

## Forbidden paths

none

## Review charter

none

## Integrations

none

## Shipping

PR bodies need no additions beyond the platform defaults.
